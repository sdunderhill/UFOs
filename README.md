# UFOs

## The Truth Is Out There

### Overview
Dana has an opportunity to collect data and wite an article about her hometown McMinnville, OR. McMinnville, OR is known for it's UFO sightings history. Dana decided to put together a website of UFO sightings around the world. I created a website for her that displays all of the sightings records. Since there are a multitude of sightings, I created 5 different filters to easily navigate all the information.

### Results
When the page first loads, the user will see every piece of information from the data sheet I was given along with a blank filter with the options from the first entry showing as place holders.

The user can start with any of the filters. I started with the date.

![1 6 2010 filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81715217/126907209-a0b2099c-98e4-414f-8cb9-272ac646c3ee.png)

When entries are made on another filter option, it filters off of the first filter set in place. Meaning that each filter compounds on top of the one set previously. I Filtered the state next.

To reset the page, the user has two options. They can either manually clear all the fields in each filter option or they can click on the words UFO sightings in the upper left corner. I have included text for the user with the easiest reset instructions as you can see in the blank filter image.

### Summary

The website has a lot of information, but it also leaves a lot out. The data doesn't cover a wide time span. It would be more informational if it included data that went beyond a 13 day timespan. 

I recommend updatimg the data.js file with a more comprehensive list of sightings. 

I would also recommend adding another filter for comments. The user would be able to filter keywords. If they were looking for more information about a sighting they heard about but didn't know any of the other specific information they would still be able to search.
